    title: "Spaceflight Associated Neuro-ocular Syndrome (SANS) Risk Assessment for Mars Missions",
    summary: "This comprehensive study examined visual impairment and intracranial pressure changes in 45 astronauts following ISS missions lasting 4-12 months. Using advanced OCT imaging and MRI analysis, researchers documented structural changes in the optic disc, retinal nerve fiber layer, and choroidal folds. The study revealed that 70% of astronauts experienced some degree of visual changes, with longer missions correlating with more severe symptoms. Machine learning analysis identified key biomarkers predictive of SANS development.",
